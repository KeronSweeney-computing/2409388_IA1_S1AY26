        <p class="lead">
          As a Jamaican university student, I have to juggle several classes, homework, and due dates. In addition to creating practice problems for subjects like database design and web development, an AI study coach might assist me in planning my study schedule and decomposing difficult subjects into manageable sessions).

        <h2>Why it would be useful</h2>
        <ul class="clean">
          <li>Benefit 1 (Saves time: Students don't have to wait for a tutor to provide them with practice questions and explanations.)</li>
          <li>Benefit 2( Enhances performance: Rather than restating the student's prior knowledge, the AI concentrates on areas of weakness.)</li>
          <li>Benefit 3( Promotes discipline: With reminders and well-thought-out programs, it assists pupils in developing regular study habits.)</li>

        <h2>Ethical Issues</h2>
